After all the long calls,
the late-night talks,
the hours of saying “no you hang up first”…

I realized something.
My favorite moments weren’t always the loud ones.

They were the quiet ones.
The times we just sat there,
with our chocolates,
barely saying anything.

No dramatic speeches.
No deep conversations.

Just you and Me.
And that soft, comfortable silence.
And somehow…
that felt louder than any long call.

The way we’d unwrap the chocolate slowly.
The way our hands would accidentally touch.
The way we’d just smile at each other
like idiots who didn’t need words.

If love had a flavor,
I swear it would taste exactly like that chocolate we shared.
Warm...Sweet.
A little messy.And perfect in the simplest way.

Honestly…
I’d choose those silent chocolate moments with you
over hours of talking to anyone else.
Because with you,
even silence feels full.
And if I had to choose
between every chocolate in the world…

I’d still choose you.

Every time.
