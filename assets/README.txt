Place your personal assets here:

- music.mp3 -> optional soft romantic background music (must be named exactly 'music.mp3')
- Add your photos (e.g., memory1.jpg, memory2.jpg) and then edit `valentine.html` to point to them instead of the placeholder images.

Notes:
- Music will NOT autoplay — user must press the 🔈 toggle in the header.
- Replace the placeholders in the Memories grid by changing the `src` attribute in `valentine.html`.
- Customize the love letter text inside `script.js` in the `loveLetter` variable.

Enjoy 💖
